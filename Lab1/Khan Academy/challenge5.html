    <h1>The coolest creature</h1>

    <p>The swans <em> are the largest extant members of the waterfowl family Anatidae</em> and are among the largest
        flying birds.<strong>Swans usually mate for life,</strong> although "divorce" sometimes occurs, particularly
        following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of eggs
        in each clutch ranges from three to eight .</p>

    <h2> Behavior</h2>
    <p>Swans feed in water and on land. They are almost entirely herbivorous, although they may eat small amounts of
        aquatic animals. In the water, food is obtained by up-ending or dabbling, and their diet is composed of the
        roots, tubers, stems and leaves of aquatic and submerged plants. </p>
