        Aloha Spirit
    </h2>
    <p id="aloha-reason"> Yes, the aloha spirit is a real thing, and yes, it is present everywhere you go. From the
        smiling faces walking down the sidewalks to the friendly person who lets you in or out of traffic to that
        stranger offering to take you on a tour of the beautiful islands, you will feel the aloha spirit even if you
        aren’t looking for it.
